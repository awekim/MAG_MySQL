If you are an R user, and try to connect R to MySQL,
you may face this error saying "Failed to connect to database: Error: Plugin caching_sha2_password could not be loaded".

I noticed that this problem happens when old mysqlclient version or libmariadbclicent isn't installed.
I have found the solutions from the link below, and added more details to it

Step 1) Open the mySql 8.0 command client
- Once you open the command file, it asks you for the password. This password should be the one you set for the installaion.

Step 2) Reset the current user password
- Type the following command,
'root'@'localhost'='yourpassword';
- In MySQL command line, all your command should finish with ; to run the code.
- If it worked well, you should receive the response saying "Query OK, 0 rows affected"

Step 3) Change the mysql native password
- type the following command,
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'yourpassword'; 
- If it worked well, you should receive the response saying "Query OK, 0 rows affected"

If you are an R user, and try create new table by using RMySQL,
you may face this error saying 
"Error in .local(conn, statement, ...) : 
  could not run statement: The total number of locks exceeds the lock table size".

I have found the solutions from the link below, and added more details to it   
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6901108/the-total-number-of-locks-exceeds-the-lock-table-size/50235106"

1. Stop the MySQL server
- open services.msc and stop MySQL

2. Open the file my.cnf from the server. 
(In my case, it's located at C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0)

3. Add the line innodb_buffer_pool_size=64MB to this file.
The default setting is 8MB.

4. Restart the MySQL server
- open services.msc and start MySQL

When importing MAG to MySQL, you may receive this error saying
"Error Code: 1290. The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement"

For this case, here are the solutions for Windows users. 
(Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32737478/how-should-i-tackle-secure-file-priv-in-mysql)

1. Stop the MySQL server service by going into services.msc.
2. Go to C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6 (ProgramData was a hidden folder in my case).
3. Open the my.ini file in Notepad.
4. Search for 'secure-file-priv'.
5. Comment the line out by adding '#' at the start of the line. For MySQL Server 5.7.16 and above, commenting won't work. You have to set it to an empty string like this one - secure-file-priv=""
6. Save the file.
7. Start the MySQL server service by going into services.msc.
